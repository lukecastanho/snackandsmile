# Snack&Smile Starter Site

This is a lightweight, static website for a vending machine business.

## Quick start
1. Upload these files to a **public** GitHub repository (root).
2. In **Settings â†’ Pages**, deploy from the `main` branch, root folder.
3. Add a **Custom domain** if you have one and enable **Enforce HTTPS**.
4. Replace `yourdomain.com`, phone, and city in `index.html`, `robots.txt`, and `sitemap.xml`.
5. (Optional) Use Formspree for the contact form: replace the `action` with your form endpoint.
